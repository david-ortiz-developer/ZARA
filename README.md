# **ZARAfit iOS Coding Exercise**

This repository contains the solution for the iOS coding exercise required for the Cibernos iOS software engineer position application. It encompasses unit tests, UI tests, image cache management, error handling, search/filter functionalities, network error simulation, and performance measurement tests.

## **Project Structure**

- **ZARAfit**: Main folder containing the Xcode project.
  - **ZARAfit**: Project files and structure.
    - **SupportingFiles**: Additional project files.
    - **Modules**: Contains VIPER files for different views like `CharactersList` and `CharactersDetail`.
    - **Extensions**: Swift extensions.
    - **Resources**: Fonts, assets, images, and animations.
  - **ZARAfitTests**: Folder for unit tests.
  - **ZARAfitUITests**: Folder for UI tests.
  - **LottieAnimations**: Folder for JSON animation files generated by Lottie.

## **Running the Project**

1. Open the `ZARAfit.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
2. Select the desired simulator or device.
3. Build and run the project.

## **Dependencies**

This project utilizes the Lottie Framework for animations, integrated using Swift Package Manager.

### **Lottie**

[Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) is a powerful library for rendering animations, enabling seamless integration of high-quality animations into iOS applications.

Lottie has been successfully integrated using Swift Package Manager.

## **Unit Tests**

Unit tests have been carefully designed to validate the code's accuracy and verify various functionalities:

- `testCharactersList`: Tests the character listing.
- `testCharacterPages`: Validates the character pages count.
- `testCharacterStatus`: Verifies character statuses.
- `testCharacterImages`: Checks character image URLs.
- `testCharacterOriginURL`: Ensures character origin URLs are valid.
- `testNetworkError`: Validates networking error handling.

To run the unit tests, open Xcode, select the `ZARAfitTests` scheme, and execute the tests. For UI tests, select the `testIfAlexanderIsDead` test. It simulates scrolling three times, tapping on the character "Alexander," and then verifies if the status is dead.

## **UI Tests**

UI tests are designed to guarantee the correctness of the UI and validate interface elements:

- `testCharactersList`: Tests character listing.
- `testCryingMortyEmptyTable`: Validates the display of an empty table view cell for empty filter results.

## **Network Error Simulation**

The `FakeInteractor` class simulates network errors. The `testNetworkError` checks the behavior under simulated network error conditions.

## **Performance Measurement**

The `testPerformanceExample` method showcases how to measure the initial list loading view's performance.
